The "SMS Spam Detection" project aims to develop a system that can automatically identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this system will analyze textual data from SMS messages to detect patterns and features indicative of spam. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to create an accurate and efficient spam detection model that can be integrated into messaging platforms, enhancing user experience by reducing unwantedÂ messages.
